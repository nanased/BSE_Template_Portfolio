# Smart Mirror
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is loading the base project. First, I worked on date and time. I used setInterval method to update the time consistently, 1000 milliseconds. I've also worked on weather, which I used openweather API. When starting on using API, I used axios to get the data from a HTTP request, and show the data into console. I tried displaying both celsius and fahrenheit, using the math.round function. After data, time and weather, I worked on Google Calendar API which was the most difficult task in the second milestone. Since the API only allows to display in console, I had to bring it out. Adding to that the calendar plans are listed in array,  which I had to use map function to describe each events.

# First Milestone

My first milestone is to set up Raspberry Pi, and research about the load project of the Smart Mirror. In order to set up Raspberry Pi, I plugged in power, HDMI cable to conenct to my monitor, and also a mouse and a keyboard. I also set up on SSH and VNC to connect to other computer and control from them. I had a trouble turning on the screen which I realized that I had to set the monitor on, then Raspberry Pi's power. I spent many time on researching React, watching videos and moving my hands to figure out how it works. Since I've never touched to React, I had a lot of difficulties learning new things. However, the reseaarch helped me get clear idea of what React is. Afterwards, I forked a repository and followed the instructions to install a template of codes.
